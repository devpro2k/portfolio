            used in my JS. When collecting input or textarea use (Value).
            Key-value Pairs is illustrated by an old fashioned phonebook,
            Key= the persons Name, Value= the persons phone number and address.
            Loads = the part of the key-value retrieves. An example would
            be story names the user creates for each story written.

          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <p>Meeting early in the week has proven to be best practice for team
            projects. NOTE: start the reading assignments early at the begining
            of the week for annotating purposes and time enough for exercises.
            The team project creating a calculator presented an issue early with
            concatenation. This was resolved by adding the Number constructor.
            The Ninja quiz was an inresting use of both functions and arrays.

          <li>
            What are some references or tools to better understand how to interpret
            a 32-bit number?
          <li>When would a litteral function ever be something other than a
            string?</li>
          <li>Is there a best practice for cataloging arrays in lengthy
            code files, so I can reuse or slice/splice what may have already been
            used? The purpose of my question stems from the idea of eliminating
            duplication in my code.</li>

          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <p>I've discovered the briallance of annotating a PDF. I am able to add so much more
            to the text by making it a conversation between me and the author. I've also found
            highlighting with notes attached allows me to link outside resources such as MDN Docs.
            I've noticed members of my team and hte author of JSNinja prefer writing methods and
            functions in short hand. I need more pratice with shorthand syntax, and better reference
            comments within my code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h4>Questions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Is it better to use a fat arrow '=>' in a function versus an 'IF' statement?
            What do develpoers prefer to use and why?</li>
          <li>
            I'm unclear about best practices for using () or [] notation. Which notation
            type do most developers prefer?</li>
          <li>Does the keywaord 'THIS' get used in the realword? The author of JSNinja uses it
            often?</li>
          <li>Does JavaScript exclusively use DOM methods in comparison to other programming
            languages?</li>
          <li>Is there a case overriding a property value versus changing the original
            code value entry? If so, what is the best practice if I know ahead of time I
            may to reuse the orginal object throughout my code?</li>
          </li>
          <li>How does JSON differ from an array, and which perferd by today's developers?</li>
          <li>Is a method namespace always followed by a ':', and is there a time a method
            doesn't include a function?</li>
          <li>What is the significance of a DOM NODE? Does NODE refer to hierarchical
            parent-child relationship?</li>
          <li>Is NODE-LIST an array, or is it a hierarchical layer of elements, e.g. z-index?</li>
          <li>What is the reason for the '$' before the variable namespace e.g. $('ul#roster')?</li>
          <li>Are JQUERY and DOM similar?</li>

          <a href="week04/hero.html">Hero exercise</a>
          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <p>Javascript has an hierarchy therefore varibles must be declared before they can be
            used. Once a varible is declared it is global and can be use throughout the code,
            unless the variable needs to be altered within an object. Debuging is key to
            understanding better code writing. Breakpoints are placed at the end of functions at
            the ";" which pauses the code for examination. The spread operator (...) turns a
            node list into an array.
          <h4>Questions:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>How does bracket notation differ from index notation? Also, when decalring a form
              varible reference is square bracket notation always used?</li>
            <li>What causes handler violations while running a js listner, and how can I overcome them?</li>
            <li>Is a constructor literal with a function global, or does it need a separate
              declaration within each new object? I'm how I could reupose the code if I only wanted to
              change the operator?</li>
            <li>Is there ever a case for creating a constructed Array, or should all arrays be made literal?</li>
            <li>Does a constructor class create a new class with in the HTML when that section of code runs?</li>
            <li>Are object mixins simailr to mixins used with SCSS, or are object mixins similar to an array?</li>
            <li>Are Node.js and Jquery commonly used together and what are the drawbacks? I'm curious if using a
              JS libraiers is a common practice for medium and large project deployments that use or have several
              applications?</li>

          <h3>Week05</h3>
          <a href="week05/index.html">Great Hikes</a>
          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <p>JS can be modular with separate boject files reference in the main.js.
            JS can be used to create arrays in lieu of JSON files, which may be more poractical with smaller
            development projects. My team members all seem to prefer alerts over breakpoints
            when debugging when the error can not be found. User a debugger statement within a
            function is another method of pausing, or runng code up until the debugger line of
            code. NOTE, if debugger is used as a troublshooting technique, remove it before shipping
            the code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h4>Questions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I've never used strict mode and I'm certain when to use it. What advantage does strict mode have If
            I am aonly using it a function level?
          <li>Does the use of JSLint take the place of using strict mode? Also, which method makes more sense when
            while debugging code?</li>
          <li>Does strict mode code take a higher priorty as the code runs?</li>
          <li>Do devolpers still use NPM? Is there a better way to debug as you code? It seems as if jumpin in
            and out of visual Studio to run a command line script or argument would be counter productive.</li>
          <li>Is ti a common practice for a company to write their own API's? If so, is there a governing body that
            enforces or regulates the intellectual rights and licensing for the API?</li>
          <li> Would you please provide another refence that explains how to code a graceful error?</li>
          <li> This is more of an observation rather than a question. It appears the author mentioned multiple
            methods for dugging only to conclude with "this method is not reccommended." What are teh best methods
            for degging today's code writing?</li>
          <li>I've been using breakpoints to debug JS for a while, typically just after a function statement.
            Where is the best place to set a breakpoint and should breakpoints be used sparingly?</li>
          <li>When I see a line of code ('${somename}), is the ${somename} referencing a vaiable or an object?</li>
          <li>Is console.trace() preferred of console.log(), or are they two different things?</li>
          <li> Should the constructor function "new" ever be used? I understood this to be a deprecadted</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <h3>Week06</h3>
      <a href="week06/index.html">ToDo Mid-term Project</a>
      <h4>Notes:</h4>
      <p>This project turned out to be much harder than I thought it would be. Some of the major blockers
        included js modules. I had difficulty making the imports work. Also, I could have bugeted my time
        better to include a button listner for filtering content.
      </p>
      </li>
      <h4>Questions:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Could you provide an office hours Zoom to go over js module, or at least point me to a sandbox resource?
