          <p>When I want to dispay or show something to a user (innerHTML) is
          used in my JS. When collecting input or textarea use (Value).<br>
          Key-value Pairs is illustrated by an old fashioned phonebook,
          Key= the persons Name, Value= the persons phone number and address.<br>
          Loads = the part of the key-value retrieves. An example would
          be story names the user creates for each story written.

            How big of a container is the localstorage, and how do I mangae
            it's size?
          <li>What is the best way to code localstorage that is sizable,
            so that reloads don't cvause performance issues?</li>
          <li>What are the key factors to dertermine when a databse is needed,
            and what database software to use?</li>
          <li>How would I like the database to my input queries?</li>

          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <p>Meeting early in the week has proven to be best practice for team
          projects. NOTE: start the reading assignments early at the begining
          of the week for annotating purposes and time enough for exercises.
          The team project creating a calculator presented an issue early with
          concatenation. This was resolved by adding the Number constructor.
          The Ninja quiz was an inresting use of both functions and arrays.

        <h4>Questions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What are some references or tools to better understand how to interpret
            a 32-bit number?
          <li>When would a litteral function ever be something other than a
            string?</li>
          <li>Is there a best practice for cataloging arrays in lengthy
            code files, so I can reuse or slice/splice what may have already been
            used? The purpose of my question stems from the idea of eliminating
            duplication in my code.</li>
          <li>Are there exentsions within VScode to keep the code dry??</li>

          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <p>I've discovered the briallance of annotating a PDF. I am able to add so much more
            to the text by making it a conversation between me and the author. I've also found
            highlighting with notes attached allows me to link outside resources such as MDN Docs.
            I've noticed members of my team and hte author of JSNinja prefer writing methods and
            functions in short hand. I need more pratice with shorthand syntax, and better reference
            comments within my code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <h4>Questions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Is it better to use a fat arrow '=>' in a function versus an 'IF' statement?
            What do develpoers prefer to use and why?</li>
          <li>
            I'm unclear about best practices for using () or [] notation. Which notation
            type do most developers prefer?</li>
          <li>Does the keywaord 'THIS' get used in the realword? The author of JSNinja uses it
            often?</li>
          <li>Does JavaScript exclusively use DOM methods in comparison to other programming
            languages?</li>
          <li>Is there a case overriding a property value versus changing the original
            code value entry? If so, what is the best practice if I know ahead of time I
            may to reuse the orginal object throughout my code?</li>
          </li>
          <li>How does JSON differ from an array, and which perferd by today's developers?</li>
          <li>Is a method namespace always followed by a ':', and is there a time a method
            doesn't include a function?</li>
          <li>What is the significance of a DOM NODE? Does NODE refer to hierarchical
            parent-child relationship?</li>
          <li>Is NODE-LIST an array, or is it a hierarchical layer of elements, e.g. z-index?</li>
          <li>What is the reason for the '$' before the variable namespace e.g. $('ul#roster')?</li>
          <li>Are JQUERY and DOM similar?</li>
